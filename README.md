# Predicting Credit Credibility: Final Team Project

## Objective
The objective of this project was to predict customer credit credibility using machine learning techniques. The team employed a dataset containing customer information and credit-related features to develop a predictive model.

## Problem Definition
The team worked with a dataset featuring customer information, which included various demographic and financial variables. The primary task was to explore, analyze, clean, preprocess, and engineer features from the dataset to develop a machine learning model to predict customer credit credibility.

## Project Phases

### 1. Data Exploration and Analysis (EDA)
- Explored the dataset's structure, dimensions, and types of data.
- Visualized relationships between features and the target variable to identify patterns, trends, and outliers.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values appropriately and addressed inconsistencies or errors in the data.
- Ensured data integrity and consistency.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Selected relevant features and created new features to improve predictive performance.
- Converted categorical variables into numerical representations and scaled or normalized numerical features.

### 4. Problem Definition
- Defined the specific problem to solve, such as predicting credit limit value, credit segmentation, or credit risk.

### 5. Model Selection and Implementation
- Chose suitable machine learning algorithms and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Trained, tuned, and validated the chosen models.

### 6. Evaluation and Interpretation
- Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics and provided insights into influential features for predictions.

### 7. Conclusion and Recommendations
- Summarized findings, conclusions, and recommended actions based on model predictions.
- Discussed potential future directions to improve model performance.
